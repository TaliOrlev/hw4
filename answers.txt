a. we have 54 articles, and assuming every article takes 2 minutes, it will take us almost two hours to do that.
b. we learn from this exercise that a machine can help us to save time and do boring jobs faster. we can use this idea to learn about hot topics in the world, what people are intrested in, we can search piece of information that we need in large articles.
c. yes, we can repeat it automatically. in order to do this every hour, we need to add a special command that will do our script every hour (or every time we want, not necessarily every hour). for example, one of the ways to do it is the command "cron". if we want to do the script every hour, we need to read all of the articles all over again, because articles can change, and we want to be accurate. if we ignore this condition, and assume that articles don't change, we need to checkfor every article if its link exists in the links list from one hour ago, and if it does we move on to the next article.
